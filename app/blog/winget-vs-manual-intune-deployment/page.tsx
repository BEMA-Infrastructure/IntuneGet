                Every IT administrator who has deployed applications through
                Microsoft Intune knows the drill: download the installer, run the
                Win32 Content Prep Tool, write detection rules, configure install
                commands, upload the package, test, troubleshoot, and repeat. For a
                single application, this process consumes anywhere from 45 minutes
                to two hours. Multiply that across a catalog of 50 or 100
                applications, and you are looking at weeks of repetitive work that
                drains time from higher-value projects.

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                The Windows Package Manager (Winget) introduced a standardized way
                to discover and install applications on Windows. Tools like{" "}

                take that a step further by bridging the gap between Winget and
                Intune, automating the entire packaging and deployment pipeline.
                This article breaks down exactly where manual Intune deployment
                falls short, how Winget-based automation addresses each pain point,
                and the measurable time savings your team can expect.

              </h2>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                To understand why automation wins, it helps to walk through every
                step of a manual Intune Win32 app deployment. Each step introduces
                time cost, and more importantly, opportunities for human error that
                can cascade into deployment failures across your entire device fleet.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 1: Sourcing the installer (10-15 minutes)
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                The process starts with finding the correct installer binary. You
                navigate to the vendor website, locate the download page (which may
                have changed since your last visit), select the correct architecture
                (x64 vs x86 vs ARM64), and download the file. For some vendors,
                direct download links are buried behind login walls or marketing
                pages that push cloud-based alternatives. Once downloaded, you need
                to verify the file hash to confirm you have an untampered binary.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 2: IntuneWin packaging (5-10 minutes)
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Microsoft Intune requires Win32 applications in the{" "}
                <code>.intunewin</code> format. You download the Microsoft Win32
                Content Prep Tool, create a source folder with the installer, and
                run <code>IntuneWinAppUtil.exe</code> to generate the package. This
                step is relatively straightforward, but it requires maintaining the
                Content Prep Tool, organizing source folders, and ensuring the
                correct setup file is specified.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 3: Configuring app metadata in Intune (5-10 minutes)
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                In the Intune admin center, you create a new Win32 app, upload the{" "}
                <code>.intunewin</code> file, and manually fill in the app name,
                description, publisher, version, and category. None of this metadata
                carries over from the installer -- you type everything by hand or
                copy it from the vendor website.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 4: Install and uninstall commands (5-15 minutes)
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                You must specify the exact command line for silent installation and
                uninstallation. MSI installers use{" "}
                <code>msiexec /i installer.msi /qn</code>, but EXE-based installers
                vary wildly: some accept <code>/S</code>, others use{" "}
                <code>--silent</code>, <code>/VERYSILENT</code>, or proprietary
                flags. Finding the correct silent switches often requires consulting
                the vendor documentation or community forums, and getting this wrong
                means a failed deployment across every targeted device.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 5: Detection rules (10-20 minutes)
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Detection rules tell Intune how to verify that an application
                installed successfully. You choose between MSI product code
                detection, file existence checks, or registry key detection. For
                MSI installers, you need to extract the product code (using tools
                like Orca or PowerShell). For EXE installers, you need to know the
                exact installation path and main executable filename. Getting
                detection rules wrong is the single most common cause of Intune
                deployment failures -- the app installs correctly, but Intune
                reports it as failed because the detection check does not match.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 6: Testing and troubleshooting (10-30 minutes)
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                After uploading, you assign the app to a test device group, wait for
                the Intune Management Extension to process the assignment, monitor
                the installation, and verify the detection rule triggers correctly.
                If something fails, you review the IntuneManagementExtension.log on
                the device, identify the issue, fix it in the portal, and repeat.
                Each troubleshooting cycle adds another 10-15 minutes.
              </p>

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mt-6">
                <strong className="text-text-primary">Total time per application:</strong>{" "}
                45 to 90 minutes, assuming no major issues. In practice, a
                significant percentage of first-attempt deployments require at least
                one troubleshooting cycle, pushing the realistic average closer to
                60-90 minutes per app.

                    correct installer URL, hash, and architecture are pulled from

                the savings reach multiple work weeks. The quarterly update cycle
                row is particularly significant: manual deployments require
                re-sourcing updated installers, re-packaging, and updating
                detection rules for version changes, while IntuneGet&apos;s automated
                update system handles this with minimal intervention.

                other work, recall the specific packaging requirements for that
                installer type, and re-engage with the Intune portal workflow.

                Time savings alone justify automation, but error reduction is
                equally compelling. Manual Intune deployment introduces human
                error at multiple points in the workflow, and each error can
                affect hundreds or thousands of managed devices. Here are the
                most common failure categories and how Winget automation
                addresses them:

                Detection rule mistakes
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Incorrect detection rules are the leading cause of Intune
                deployment failures. Common mistakes include pointing to the
                wrong file path (for example, using <code>Program Files</code>{" "}
                when the application installs to{" "}
                <code>Program Files (x86)</code>), entering an incorrect MSI
                product code, or setting the wrong version comparison operator.
                When a detection rule fails, Intune reports the application as
                not installed even though the binary is present on the device.
                This triggers repeated installation attempts that waste bandwidth
                and create confusing reports in the admin console.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                IntuneGet reads the Winget manifest to determine the installer
                type and generates detection rules accordingly. For MSI packages,
                it extracts the product code directly. For EXE installers, it
                uses the default installation path and executable name from the
                manifest. This eliminates the guesswork that leads to detection
                failures.

                <code>/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES</code>. Burn bundles use{" "}
                <code>/quiet</code>. Using the wrong switch does not just fail
                silently -- it can launch an interactive installer GUI on the
                endpoint with no user logged in, causing the process to hang
                indefinitely and block subsequent Intune policy evaluations.

                The Winget manifest includes the installer type and the specific
                silent install arguments for each package. IntuneGet maps these
                directly to the Intune install command configuration, ensuring
                that the correct flags are applied every time.

                When you update a manually deployed application, you need to

                it, update the detection rule version string, and re-upload. If
                you update the installer but forget to update the detection rule,
                Intune may fail to detect the new version. If you update the
                detection rule but not the installer, devices get an outdated
                binary that passes a version check it should not.

                and detection configuration stay synchronized because they all

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                The comparison between manual and Winget-based Intune deployment
                is not close. Manual deployment demands 45-90 minutes per
                application, introduces errors at every step, and scales poorly
                as your application catalog grows. Winget automation through
                IntuneGet reduces that to approximately 5 minutes per app,
                eliminates the most common failure categories, and turns quarterly
                update cycles from multi-day projects into tasks that complete in
                a few hours.

                For the standard software that makes up the bulk of enterprise
                application catalogs -- browsers, communication tools,
                productivity suites, developer utilities -- there is no practical
                reason to continue deploying manually. Reserve the manual process
                for the small number of custom LOB applications that genuinely
                require hand-crafted packaging, and automate everything else.

                The time your team recovers from eliminating manual Intune
                deployment is time that can be redirected toward security
                hardening, compliance initiatives, or improving the end-user
                experience -- work that creates far more value than clicking
                through the same packaging wizard for the hundredth time. Ready
