                Deploying applications to Microsoft Intune remains one of the most
                time-consuming tasks for IT administrators. Between downloading
                installers, creating IntuneWin packages, writing detection rules, and
                configuring deployment settings, a single app can take hours to get
                right. The Windows Package Manager (Winget) has changed how Windows
                applications are discovered and installed -- but bridging the gap between
                Winget and Intune has traditionally required significant manual effort.

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Winget to Intune deployment is the process of taking applications from
                the Windows Package Manager (Winget) repository and packaging them for
                distribution through Microsoft Intune. Winget maintains a repository
                of over 10,000 application packages with verified installers, version
                metadata, and hash validation. Intune, as Microsoft&apos;s cloud-based
                endpoint management platform, requires applications in a specific
                format -- the <code>.intunewin</code> package -- with detection rules
                that verify successful installation.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                The challenge lies in the translation layer between these two systems.
                Winget applications use standard installer formats (MSI, EXE, MSIX)
                while Intune needs those installers wrapped in the IntuneWin format
                along with install commands, uninstall commands, detection rules, and
                requirement rules. Automating this translation is where tools like
                IntuneGet deliver the most value.

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Before Winget, IT admins sourcing applications for Intune had to
                manually visit vendor websites, download installers, verify file
                integrity, and hope the download link would remain stable for future
                updates. Winget solves several critical problems:

                is a free, open-source tool that fully automates the Winget to Intune

                packaging, detection rule generation, and Intune upload in a single
                workflow. Here is how to deploy your first Winget app to Intune using
                IntuneGet:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 1: Sign in with your Microsoft Entra ID
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Navigate to{" "}

                </Link>{" "}
                and sign in with your Microsoft Entra ID account. IntuneGet uses
                Microsoft authentication directly -- no separate account creation
                needed. Your account needs Intune admin permissions
                (DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All) to create and upload app packages.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Before any deployment, IntuneGet runs a pre-upload permission check
                that tests your actual API access. This catches permission issues
                before you invest time in packaging, avoiding the frustrating mid-process
                failures common with manual deployment.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Step 2: Search and select applications from the Winget catalog
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Use the search bar to find applications from the full Winget repository
                of 10,000+ packages. IntuneGet supports partial and fuzzy search -- type
                &quot;chr&quot; to find Google Chrome, or &quot;code&quot; to find Visual Studio Code. For
                applications that are difficult to find by name, IntuneGet includes
                AI-powered app discovery that uses OpenAI to match your search query to
                the correct Winget package ID.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Select one or multiple applications to deploy. You can review the
                package details including version, publisher, installer type, and

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Click the deploy button and IntuneGet handles the rest. Behind the
                scenes, it performs the following steps automatically:

              <ol className="space-y-2 text-text-secondary list-decimal list-inside">
                <li>Downloads the application installer from the Winget source</li>
                <li>Creates the <code>.intunewin</code> package using the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool</li>
                <li>Generates detection rules based on the installer type (MSI product code, file path, or registry key)</li>
                <li>Configures install and uninstall commands with silent switches</li>

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mt-4">
                The entire process takes approximately 5 minutes per application. Once

                The manual approach gives you complete control over every aspect of
                packaging but requires significantly more time and scripting knowledge.
                Here is the typical workflow for manually deploying a Winget app to

              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Whether you use IntuneGet or the manual approach, certain issues can
                arise when deploying Winget apps to Intune. Here are the most common
                problems and their solutions:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Detection rule failures
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                The most common deployment issue is incorrect detection rules. If
                Intune cannot verify that an application installed successfully, it
                will report the deployment as failed even though the app is present on
                the device. For MSI-based installers, use the MSI product code for
                detection. For EXE installers, use file existence checks (verify the
                main executable path) or registry key detection. IntuneGet automatically
                selects the most reliable detection method based on the installer type.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                System context vs user context installation
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Intune Win32 apps install in system context by default. Some
                applications, particularly those designed for per-user installation,
                may fail or install to unexpected locations when run as SYSTEM. If you
                encounter installation failures, check whether the application supports
                machine-wide installation and adjust the install behavior in Intune
                accordingly.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">
                Installer type mismatches
              </h3>
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Winget packages can contain different installer types (MSI, EXE, MSIX,
                Burn bundles). Each type requires different silent install switches and
                detection strategies. A common mistake in manual deployment is using
                MSI switches (<code>/qn</code>) for EXE-based installers that use
                different silent flags (<code>/S</code>, <code>/silent</code>,{" "}
                <code>--silent</code>). IntuneGet reads the Winget manifest to
                determine the correct installer type and applies the appropriate
                command-line switches automatically.

                  <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                    Winget to Intune deployment is the process of taking applications
                    from the Windows Package Manager (Winget) repository and packaging
                    them for distribution through Microsoft Intune. This involves
                    converting application installers into the .intunewin format,
                    configuring detection rules, and uploading them to your Intune
                    tenant for assignment to devices.

                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                    Yes. IntuneGet is completely free and open source under the MIT
                    license. There are no seat limits, no hidden fees, and no premium
                    tiers. You can deploy as many Winget apps to Intune as you need at
                    zero cost.

                  <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                    Using IntuneGet, a typical Winget app can be deployed to Intune in
                    about 5 minutes. This includes searching for the app, automatic
                    packaging into .intunewin format, detection rule generation, and
                    upload to your Intune tenant. Manual deployment of the same app
                    typically takes 1-2 hours.

                    Yes. IntuneGet includes an automated update management system that
                    monitors Winget for new app versions and can automatically update
                    your Intune deployments. You can configure update policies including
                    auto-update, notify-only, ignore, or pin to a specific version.

                  <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                    Intune&apos;s built-in Winget catalog provides a subset of Winget apps

                    10,000+ Winget repository, provides automatic IntuneWin packaging,
                    generates detection rules, supports automated updates, and includes
                    AI-powered app discovery. IntuneGet gives IT admins more control

                    Yes. IntuneGet can be self-hosted using Docker, giving you complete

                Deploying Winget apps to Microsoft Intune does not have to be a
                time-consuming, error-prone process. While the manual approach gives
                you full control and the built-in catalog offers convenience for basic
                needs, IntuneGet provides the best balance of automation, app coverage,
                and flexibility for IT teams that manage application deployments at
                scale.

                With automatic IntuneWin packaging, intelligent detection rule
                generation, and configurable update policies, IntuneGet turns what was
                traditionally an hours-long process into a 5-minute workflow. And
                because it is free and open source, there is no financial barrier to
